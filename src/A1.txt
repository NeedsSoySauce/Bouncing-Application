 - How much time did the assignment take you overall?

Around 12 hours.

 - Which areas of the assignment did you find easy and which ones were difficult?

Everything was mostly okay, although the specifications were a little confusing as some of the information provided in
the specification document didn't match what was on Coderunner2 (or wasn't there at all) and vice versa.
MovingQuadCircles was the hardest thing to implement.

 - Which topics in the course did the assignment most help you understand?

Inheritance is the main one. I did learn a little bit about GUI programming as well from looking at the provided code,
but it wasn't anything I couldn't already find online.

 - Any other comments you would like to make.

Compared to the projects in COMPSCI 130 and ENGGEN 131 this project felt quite short. Nonetheless, it was still
enjoyable. Thank you!
